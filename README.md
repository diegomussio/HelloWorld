Welcome to my github

As Head of Marketing (products and strategy), I have led all phases of the creative and technical elements, including data analysis, branding, documentation development, lead generation, partners/channels, customer segmentation and profiling, as well as such as CRM and acquisition strategies.

Perhaps most importantly, I offer a track record of proven results, as evidenced by the following achievements by my team:

- Capture and expansion of +38% in customer base, achieved during a period of general decline in the healthcare IT industry.
- Managed the national marketing campaign (composed of trade shows, media and public relations) for the company's recently launched technology services division.
- Developed the SEO strategy that achieved and maintained the top 5 rankings in Google and Bing (unpaid organic results) for key product search terms.
-The creation of the new branding and naming of +10 products to consolidate a cohesive corporate identity and support the new direction of the company.

Given the opportunity, I am confident in my ability to achieve similar innovative marketing results.

Thank you very much,

Diego Mussio Zanotta
